# Task Visualizer App

**This is a pet project used to study and apply some new technologies**

## Business logic
The idea is to have an app where I can organize my future tasks, prioritize then and set alarms.
More information on Documentation folder

## Technical Details
This solution consists of a C#/.Net backend and an Angular frontend
For now, both applications run on docker without any orchestrator supporting it. The plan is to move this to kubernetes.

## How to run
**TODO**

## Wish List
- [ ] Kubernetes support
- [ ] Unit tests in the front end
